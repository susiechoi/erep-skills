<p id="instructions">This website was designed as part of research at Duke University that studies whether teaching people to calm down using mindfulness can improve their social skills. Specifically, the research evaluates the effects of a new, mindfulness-based intervention on the ability to perceive other people’s emotions. The goal of this website is to offer an accessible and approachable way to assess whether/how individuals can improve in perceiving others' emotions, as well as regulating their own emotions.</p>
